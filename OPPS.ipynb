        "### 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of OOP as a way of organizing your code. Instead of having a jumble of functions and variables, you group everything into \"objects.\" Each object holds both the data it needs (we call these *attributes*) and the things it can do (we call these *methods*). This makes your code much cleaner, easier to reuse, and simpler to manage, especially as your projects get bigger.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is like a recipe or a blueprint for creating objects. It doesn't do anything on its own, but it defines all the characteristics and behaviors that an object made from it will have. For example, you could have a `Dog` class that says all dogs have a `name` and can `bark()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is the real deal, created from a class. If a `Dog` class is the blueprint, then an actual dog, like your pet Fido, would be an object. Fido has a specific name (\"Fido\") and can perform the `bark()` action. You can create many objects from a single class, each with its own unique data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. What's the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "They might sound similar, but they have different jobs:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Abstraction** is all about hiding the complicated stuff. When you drive a car, you don't need to know how the engine works; you just use the steering wheel and pedals. That's abstraction! In code, it means showing only the essential features of an object and hiding the unnecessary details.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Encapsulation** is about bundling data and the methods that work on that data together in a neat package (a class). It also involves protecting that data from being changed in unexpected ways. Think of it like a capsule for medicine – the outer layer protects what's inside.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. What are \"dunder\" methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Dunder\" is just a shorter way of saying \"double underscore.\" In Python, methods that start and end with double underscores, like `__init__()` or `__str__()`, are special. They're not meant to be called directly. Instead, they let you customize how your objects behave with Python's built-in features. For example, defining the `__str__()` method lets you decide what happens when you try to `print()` one of your objects."

        "### 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance is like a family tree for your classes. A \"child\" class can inherit all the traits (attributes and methods) from a \"parent\" class. This is a huge time-saver because you don't have to write the same code over and over again. For instance, you could have a general `Animal` class, and then a `Dog` class that inherits from it, automatically getting all the basic animal features.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism is a fancy word that means \"many forms.\" In programming, it means you can have one method that does different things depending on the object that's using it. Imagine you have a `speak()` method. For a `Dog` object, `speak()` would make it bark, but for a `Cat` object, it would make it meow. Same method name, but different results depending on the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, we can hint that certain things should be kept private by using underscores. A single underscore `_` at the beginning of a variable name is a convention that means, \"Hey, you probably shouldn't touch this from outside the class.\" A double underscore `__` is a stronger signal that an attribute is private and shouldn't be accessed directly. To control how these attributes are accessed, we can use special methods called getters and setters.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The constructor in Python is a special method called `__init__()`. It's automatically called whenever you create a new object from a class. Its main job is to set up the object's initial state, like giving it a name or setting its default values."

        "*   A **static method**, marked with `@staticmethod`, is like a regular function that just happens to live inside a class.

        "\n",
        "Python doesn't have method overloading in the traditional sense, where you can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. However, we can achieve a similar effect by using default arguments or by accepting a variable number of arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`). This lets one function behave differently based on the arguments it receives."

        "\n",
        "The `@property` decorator in Python is a neat trick that lets you treat a method like it's a regular attribute. This is really useful when you want to have a \"read-only\" property or a value that's calculated on the fly. For example, instead of having an `area` attribute that you have to update every time the radius of a circle changes, you can use a `@property` method to calculate it automatically whenever you need it.\n",

        "\n",
        "Polymorphism is a big deal in OOP because it makes your code incredibly flexible and much easier to maintain. It lets you write more general and reusable code by allowing different types of objects to be handled in the same way. Think of it as having a single remote control that can work with your TV, your sound system, and your DVD player—it simplifies everything!\n",

        "\n",
        "An abstract class is like a template for other classes. You can't create an object directly from an abstract class, but you can use it to define a set of common methods that all of its child classes must have. It's a way of enforcing a certain structure on your code and making sure that all the related classes have the same basic functionality.\n",

        "*   **Data Protection:** Encapsulation helps protect your data from being changed in unexpected ways, which makes your code more secure and reliable.\n",
        "*   **Simplicity:** Abstraction hides all the complicated details and lets you focus on what's important, which makes your code easier to understand and work with.\n",
        "*   **Flexibility:** Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with many different types of objects, which makes it incredibly versatile.\n",
        "*   **Easier Maintenance:** Because your code is so well-organized, it's much easier to find and fix bugs, and to add new features without breaking everything.\n",

        "\n",
        "The main difference between a class variable and an instance variable is how they're shared:\n",
        "\n",
